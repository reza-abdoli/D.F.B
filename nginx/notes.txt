(listen x) and (listen [::]:x) are for IPv4 and IPv6 traffics and specific port should be written for either of them

If you are using Ubuntu you also have to define in /etc/hosts your server name exp:for you local ip: 127.0.0.1 mydomain www.mydomain.com mydomain.com

server default listen port is 80 (listen 80) and (listen [::]:80) and it does not have to be specified: (www.mydomain.com is enough) otherwise if it does not 80 it must to be announced in the url exp:  (listen 8011) and (listen [::]:8011) -> www.mydomain.com:8011/

It is also possible to use the following syntax to reload nginx server after you made changes to the config file such as nginx.conf:    sudo systemctl reload nginx
also see https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/nginx-restart-ubuntu-linux-command/

html css , js and other files in home/a/... cannot access -> permission denied. they have to be put in knl route such as /var/www/X/html/ or /opt/...

ls /var/log/nginx/ ---------> info about requests exp: cat /var/log/nginx/nginx.info.error.log

using alias we could serve static files :
root /var/www/cv/dist;
index index.html;
server_name nnginx.info www.nnginx.info;
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
}
location /img {
  alias /var/www/cv/img;
}

after changing nginx config it must be reload

we can define a server with name in /etc/hosts. for exp localhost has defined as 127.0.0.1. 

//---------------------------

docker build . -t my-nginx

fisrt port 80 have to be available(not occupied)
to see if it is not occupied run sudo lsof -i:80
if it is occupied run /etc/init.d/apache2 stop otherwise try changing the port like docker run -p 8099:80 my-nginx

docker run -p 80:80 my-nginx
